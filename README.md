# Restaurant Reviews App (Stage-1):

### Note:

This Project is Created Under Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree.


### How To Run This Applicatoion :

* Download ZIP on the right Side of the screen, then extract the zip file to your Computer or clone the repository using git.

* And In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) & download Executable File (.exe) and install the software.

* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.


## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

* This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).


### Note about ES6

* Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
